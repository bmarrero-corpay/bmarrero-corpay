- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Brandon. I am from Newport News, Virginia, home of the shipbuilders and joint Army / Air Force base, Fort Eustis.
- ðŸ‘€ I have a variety of skills and passions which led to my unusual career path transitioning from film/video to car washing to now software development.
- ðŸŽ£ In my freetime I enjoy spending time with my wife and daughter, cooking, and fishing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking a deep dive into Ruby on Rails to refamiliarize myself with the framework and better understand the tech stack at Corpay.
- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m looking to connect with other developers and learn from each other. I particularly enjoy pair-programming.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have produced hundreds of videos online from editing tutorials to gaming and music videos under many aliases.
